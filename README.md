Something fun to keep the excitement of coding going... 

I feel like such a dork over how excited I get when I do something right in this new relam of computer science. I know I have worked hard in school my whole life, and I've been very successful in my studies, but after high school, college basically became a single track of strengthening my skills in certain areas of study, and completely neglecting the areas I could have used help in, ie. computers and technology. I guess I'm not a dork for jumping up and down on my bed after spending hours fixing bugs, I'm just reaccessing a childlike enthusiasm for learning : )
